<p class="style2">Set the delay according to your convenience, this is the 
amount of time you require to switch to your browser, and switch to the Full 
Screen Mode of FarmVille</p>
<p class="style2">StartY and StartY can be set using the Mouse Capture feature, 
once you do that, you can note down the co-ordinates for future reference, so 
that you don't have to go through the Mouse Capture feature again and again. To 
use the Mouse Capture Feature, perform the following steps :</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p class="style2">Set the Delay to 15 seconds</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="style2">Click on <em>Capture Screen</em></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="style2">Switch to your browser immediately and switch FarmVille to 
	full screen mode. Make sure you are completely zoomed out (i.e. Minimum size 
	)</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="style2">After 15 seconds, the browser will automatically switch to 
	normal and FVB will be in focus. Now your screen has been saved.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="style2">Click on <em>Select Start Coordinates, </em>you will see a 
	screen similar to FarmVille, now click on the starting Plot from where you 
	wish FVB to start. Be sure you are precise, and click on the exact centre of 
	the Plot.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="style2">Now your coordinates are saved, and you can Note them 
	down, so that they can be entered in the future, without using this Mouse 
	Capture Feature</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="style2">Once the StartX and StartY values are set, you can click 
	on <em>Start FVB</em> , and immediately switch to your browser, with 
	FarmVille open, full screen and full zoom-out i.e. minimum size.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="style2">After the specified amount of delay, the mouse will 
	automatically move to each Plot, automatically harvesting any size of Farm 
	within a minute.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="style2">With this application, you can Harvest, and Plow and Sow 
	your fields, just by pointing the Mouse, you need not click repeatedly. </p>
	</li>
</ul><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style6">Delete Farm</p><hr width="300px" align="left">
<p class="style2">This application has a feature where you can automatically 
delete the plots from your Farm.<br>Deleting plots en-masse is a complicated 
task, when your farm is of the order 16X16 or more, and it is a common task to 
relocate objects/livestock. To use this, you need to perform the following steps 
:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p class="style2"><strong>Capture Screen</strong> : This will take a 
	screenshot of your farm, please refer text describing how to use the Capture 
	Screen Feature.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="style2"><strong>Select Start Coordinates</strong> : Once the 
	screen has been captured, you will need to select the starting location. 
	This is done by clicking on this button and then clicking on the plot from 
	where you wish to start FVB.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="style2"><strong>Select Delete Tool</strong> : Click on this 
	button, then click on the Delete Tool which is located at the Bottom-Right 
	corner of FarmVille Screen.</p>
	</li>
	<li >
	<p class="style2"><strong><a name="deleteaccept">Select Delete Accept</a></strong> : This part is a little tricky. Here 
	you need to give the location of the &quot;OK&quot; message that pop-ups once you 
	delete something. This is a 6-step process.<br><ul>
	<li>Go to FarmVille and Select Delete Tool
	</li>
	<li>Click on a Plot( A Confirmation Popup will appear )</li>
	<li>Now come back to FVB and click on Capture Screen and switch to your FarmVille</li>

	</ul></p>
	</li>

	Deleting Field once you have set all the values correctly, and switch to 
	FarmVille.</p>

<p class="style6">Soya Bean Hack</p><hr width="300px" align="left">
<ul>
	<li>
	<p class="style2"><strong>Capture Screen</strong> : Check the delay value, 
	before clicking on this button. Click on this button and switch to FarmVille 
	[<strong> Note:</strong> This hack can be done in Normal Screen Mode, so no 
	need to switch to Full Screen Mode to capture screen ].</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="style2"><strong>Select Delete Tool</strong> : Once the screen has 
	been captured clicking this button will bring a screen very similar to your 
	Farm, click on the Delete Tool at the Bottom-Right Corner.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="style2"><strong>Select Market</strong> : Repeat the process as 
	followed to select Delete Tool, but this time click on the Market.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="style2"><strong>Select Plow Tool</strong> : Repeat the process 
	followed to Select Delete Tool, but this time click on the Plow Tool.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="style2"><strong>Select Delete Accept</strong> : Follow the steps 
	illustrated in the <strong>Delete Farm</strong> Section</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="style2"><strong>Select Plow Point</strong> : This is similar to 
	selecting the Delete Accept Tool, following are the steps.<br>
<ul>
<li>Switch to FarmVille, select Plow Tool </li>
<li>Switch Back to FVB and click on Capture Screen, check the delay value which is ideally set at 15 seconds</li>
<li>Switch to FarmVille and selecting the Plow Tool,
 aim at clear Land, where you get that Green Symbol to create a farm. 
 Don't Click, wait the screen to be captured.</li>
 <li>Once the screen is captured switch back to FVB and click on Select Plow Point, You will see a screen similar to the
 once where you just were. Try and overlap your Mouse-Pointer with the Pointer on Screen and Click. </li>
 <li>You'll get a confirmation of the location being saved</li>
</ul>	
 </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="style2"><strong>Select Start Coordinates</strong> : Once you have selected the Plow Point, click on Select 
	Start Coordinates, and click on the center of the Green Rectangle of the Plot which you were just creating</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="style2"><strong>Select Crop</strong> : The process is similar to Selecting Plow Point, and needs the 
	following steps to be performed<br>
<ul>
<li>Switch to Farmville and click on Market</li>
<li>Switch to FVB and click on Capture Screen and switch back to FarmVille, 
wait for the screen to be captured. Now click on Select Crop, and a screen 
similar to the Market will pop-up</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>Buy </strong>button of Soya Bean. You will get a confirmation
 of the coordinate being saved. </li></ul>
<p class="style2">Once you have selected the 6 locations that are required by the application, 
you might wish to save the settings. Refer to documentation. </p>
<p class="style2">2 more important parameters need to be set finally, these are </p>
<ul>
	<li class="style2"><strong>Click : </strong>This parameter specifies the time in 
	milliseconds for the application to wait between clicks. Note that, if you 
	have a slow internet connection and your Market pop-ups after the 
	application clicked on Soya Bean 
	Buy, you should increase its value. 150 is a very safe value for such 
	connections but you may need to increase further. </li>
	<li class="style2"><strong>Number of Beans : </strong>This is number of times the Soya Bean 
	Hack will be performed. Please not that you will lose 30 coins and gain 3XP 
	for every cycle. </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p class="style2">Click on Soya Bean Hack to start the process.</p>
		</li>
</ul>
	</p>
	<p class="style6"><strong>How do I stop this</strong></p>
<p class="style2">It becomes very difficult if FVB starts by mistake, since then 
it can start clicking on the screen, beyond your control. Please read this very 
carefully to avoid such a situation.<br><br>If FVB runs out of control, press 
ALT+TAB and chose FVB from the list of applications. Once FVB gains focus, it 
will stop clicking anymore, and you can safely close it. Please note that this 
works only if FVB receives proper focus, so to stop FVB you need to bring it to 
focus using the keyboard shortcut [ALT+TAB].</p>
