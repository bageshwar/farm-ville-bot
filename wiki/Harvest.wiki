  * StartY and StartY can be set using the Mouse Capture feature, once you do that, you can note down the co-ordinates for future reference, so that you don't have to go through the Mouse Capture feature again and again. To use the Mouse Capture Feature, perform the following steps :
  * Set the Delay to 15 seconds
    * Click on Capture Screen
    * Switch to your browser immediately and switch FarmVille to full screen mode. Make sure you are completely zoomed out (i.e. Minimum size )

    * Click on Select Start Coordinates, you will see a screen similar to FarmVille, now click on the starting Plot from where you wish FVB to start. Be sure you are precise, and click on the exact centre of the Plot.

  * Now you need to specify the values of GridX and GridY. Refer to documentation to know more about those variables.
  * Once the StartX and StartY values are set, you can click on Start FVB , and immediately switch to your browser, with FarmVille open, full screen and full zoom-out i.e. minimum size.
